Data Cleaning for LSE EconSoc Research

The data set consists of median weekly and annual earnings as per ONS estimates for UK Regions and Counties from 2014 to 2022. However, combining the data is complicated by the adoption of new territorial labelling which needs to be incorporated into the data set. Furthermore, there are numerous missing values which need to be dealt with as well. Plotting data from each region reveals that London has had consistently the highest earnings but growth between regions has been more or less equal. This data set is exported to STATA for the purposes of a differences-in-differences analysis for the labour research group.
